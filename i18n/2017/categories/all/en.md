### Overview

We gathered here the hottest projects of the year, from all categories.

### Vue.js strikes again

Once again, {vuejs} is the trendiest project of the year, with more than 40,000 stars added on GitHub during the year.

It's far more than in 2016 (+26,000 stars), and the gap with next contender ({react}) is even bigger.

What makes Vue.js special?

* Small learning curve, a component approach like {react} but with a more familiar syntax
* Ecosystem well defined with, a set of de-facto standards:
  * Router: {vue-router}
  * State management library: {vuex}
* The concept of single-file component that includes template, logic and styles in a single file.
* Used by one of the most popular PHP framework, [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) as the default view engine
* Not backed by a big company like Facebook or Google of the internet but maintained by [Evan You](https://github.com/yyx990803) as an open source project sponsored through crowd-sourcing

It may be related with the last point but Vue.js is very popular with developers from China.

It's used by the bigger e-commerce platform of China (Alibaba) but also by companies like GitLab or Adobe.

### React, number 2, again!

Like in 2016, {react} is number 2 again, with more than 27,000 stars added on GitHub.

{create-react-app} is the recommended way to start a new project with React, its success made a lot of "React Boilerplate" less relevant than before.

[Dan Abramov](https://github.com/gaearon) (the creator of {redux}, now working for Facebook) did a great job, finding the right balance between simplicity and features. For example there is no fancy styling solution (just plain CSS), no server-side rendering, but everything is well packaged and the developer experience is really good.

### Axios

{axios} library is most the popular HTTP client.

It can work on both client sides (AJAX requests from the client) or on the server-side (HTTP requests)

Its success may be related to Vue.js too because a lot of tutorials about Vue.js often use it to query a distant API with HTTP.

### Puppeteer

{puppeteer} is one of the great stories of the year.
Made by the Google Chrome team, it's a headless Chrome browser (a browser that runs in the background and that can by piloted by code).

I can be used to do things like:

* Testing automatically web application UI in real browsers
* Taking snapshots of web pages to do Server-side rendering
