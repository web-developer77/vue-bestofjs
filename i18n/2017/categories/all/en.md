### Overview

We gathered here the hottest projects of the year, from all categories.

### Vue.js strikes again

Once again, {vuejs} is the trendiest project of the year, with more than 40,000 stars added on GitHub during the year.

It's far more than in 2016 (26,000 stars), and the gap with the next contender ({react}) is even bigger.

What makes Vue.js special?

* First it has a small learning curve, a component approach is similar to {react} but with a more familiar syntax
* The ecosystem is well defined with, including a set of de-facto standards:
  * Router: {vue-router}
  * State management library: {vuex}
* The concept of single-file component that includes template, logic and styles in a single file `.vue` file is really nice
* It's used by one of the most popular PHP framework, [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) as the default view engine
* It's not backed by a big company of the Internet like Facebook or Google but maintained by [Evan You](https://github.com/yyx990803) as an open source project sponsored through crowd-sourcing.

It may be related with the last point but Vue.js is very popular among developers from China.

It's used by the bigger e-commerce platform of China (Alibaba) but also by companies like GitLab or Adobe.

### React, number 2, again!

Like in 2016, {react} is number 2, with more than 27,000 stars added on GitHub.

{create-react-app}, the project number 3, is the recommended way to start a new project with React, its success made a lot of "React Boilerplate" less relevant than before.

[Dan Abramov](https://github.com/gaearon) (the creator of {redux}, now working for Facebook) did a great job, finding the right balance between simplicity and features. For example there is no fancy styling solution (just plain CSS), no server-side rendering, but everything is well packaged and the developer experience is really good.

### Axios

{axios} library is the most HTTP client.

It can work on both the client side (AJAX requests from the client) or on the server-side (HTTP requests in node.js environment)

Its success may be related to Vue.js too because a lot of tutorials about Vue.js often use it to query a distant API with HTTP.

### Puppeteer

{puppeteer} is one of the great stories of the year.
Made by the Google Chrome team, it's a headless Chrome browser, that is to say a browser that runs in the background and that can by piloted by code.

It can be used to do things like:

* Testing automatically web application UI in real browsers
* Taking snapshots of web pages to do Server-side rendering
