The "front-end framework" is such a battle field but it seems that things are calming down, as 3 big players dominate the game.

### The Big-3: Vue, React and Angular

Without surprise, the 3 most popular UI frameworks are {vuejs}, {react} and {angular-2}

We all call them _frameworks_ but, to be more accurate, the only framework is {angular-2}, we should call {vuejs} and {react} _libraries_.

We talked previously about the success of {vuejs}

{react} landscape is very fragmented, developers have to make more choices about all the things that go around the view layer:

* the routing between pages
* how to fetch data
* how to bind forms to data
* how store the state of the application...

On the contrary, {angular-2} ecosystem is more controlled, more stable. There is an _Angular Way_ to do things.

That's why {angular-2} has a more "corporate" image.
This image has been emphasized with the usage of static types (it's written in {typescript}), it resonates with backend developers familiar with types from languages like C# or Java.

## Less is more

Behind the Big-3, it's very interesting to notice that {preact} is number 4.
{preact} is a smaller alternative to React library: the same API but in less than 3 KB.

The other contenders emphasize on a small footprint that leads to better performance in the browser.
