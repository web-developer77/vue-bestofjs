These are the hottest projects of the year, all categories included.

For the third year time, {vuejs} is the trendiest project of the year.

It got 45k stars overs the last 12 months, it's 5000 more stars than in 2017... the momentum is still there!

At position number 4, {deno} is the only new project among these rankings.

Deno is "a program for executing JavaScript and TypeScript outside of the web browser."

This secure TypeScript runtime was created by Ryan Dahl, the father of Node.js, in an attempt of addressing several issues about Node.js (watch [his video presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3BM9TB-8yA))
