For the 4th consecutive year, {vuejs} is the overall winner of our contest, with more then 30,000 stars added on GitHub in 2019.

No surprises at the following spots: {react} and {vs-code} follow in the same order as last year.

The biggest jump in the rankings is {vue-magic-admin}, a solution to build nice dashboards using Vue.js components.

{svelte} has been around for a few year but it really took off in 2019.

{typescript} enters the TOP 10, its success has been one of the main changes over the last years.

{deno}, the JavaScript run-time built by the creator of Node.js was one of the newcomers in 2018. It's still trendy, at the 11th position.
