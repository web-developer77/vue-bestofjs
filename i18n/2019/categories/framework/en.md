In 2019, {svelte} disrupted the category of the UI frameworks, taking the 3rd position behind {vuejs} and {react} but before {angular}.

Does it mean that we have now a BIG-4 instead of a BIG-3?

It's too early to state that Svelte will be as successful as the 3 other frameworks.

Svelte is very different that the other frameworks because it's not really a framework but a compiler that runs its magic at building time, not at run time.

It has a unique way to deal with reactivity.
