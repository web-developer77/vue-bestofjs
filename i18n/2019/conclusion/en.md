Among the interesting trends in the front-end side: will Svelte framework keep growing?

Or will we see more adoption of web standards such as web components?

One of the most interesting stories of 2019 was the fact that [Apple released its music web client](https://dev.to/ionic/apple-just-shipped-web-components-to-production-and-you-probably-missed-it-57pf) that uses Web components, compiled with {stencil}, one of the top UI frameworks of the year.
This is a "real world" usage of Web Components!

On the back-end side, Node.js turned 10 years in 2019 but new features keep being added at a fast pace.

As of v13.2.0, Node.js supports ECMAScript (ES) modules out of the box and can import Web Assembly modules.

The Workers Threads API enables heavy computing operations.

Whether we talk about the browser or Node.js, we will see new projects that leverage the new features provided by the platform in 2020.

Thank you for your attention and see you next year!
