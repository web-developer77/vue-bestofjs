2020 is a very special year for many reasons. The most important one: for the first time in 5 years the overall winner of the _Rising Stars_ is not called {vuejs} but {deno}... what a surprise!

#### The Year of the Deno

Deno is a JavaScript run-time from the creator of Node.js, Ryan Dahl.

It’s often considered as the sequel of Node.js as it fixes or improves a lot of points, taking advantage of 10 years of experience and iterations with Node.js.

Among the main features:

- TypeScript compiler is included by default (but you can write code in regular JavaScript)
- No centralized package manager, any JavaScript dependency can be loaded from any URL
- The “standard library” provides solutions for common needs that usually require the installation of packages in Node.js
- Deno uses as much as possible standards from the web (Example: the fetch API)
- Files imported using the ECMAScript modules
- Built-in test runner and debugger

The [ecosystem around Deno](https://deno.land/x/) is quite young but expect things to change a lot, given the buzz around Deno.

The success of Deno confirms 2 heavy trends:

- The rise of TypeScript language, in both frontend and client sides
- The rise of ES6 modules imported on the fly by solutions like [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/), check the new faces of the "Building Tools" section

#### Utility classes won the game?

The success of {tailwind-css} and its "utility first" approach is really interesting.

Compared to more traditional CSS frameworks like {bootstrap}, it provides naming conventions to let developers style pages and components by composing class names.

According to the [State of CSS](https://2020.stateofcss.com/en-US/report/) beautiful report, it's the CSS framework that has the highest ratio of satisfaction.

The [version 2](https://blog.tailwindcss.com/tailwindcss-v2) was released recently and it brings a lot of new features including the support of the beloved "dark mode".
