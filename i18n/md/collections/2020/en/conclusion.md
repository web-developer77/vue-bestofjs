It was an other great year in the JavaScript landscape with several new leaders in the different categories tracked by _Best of JS_.

Backend developers can have fun with {deno} while frontend developers now have faster and simpler building tools with solutions such as {esbuild}, {rome} and {vite}.

For styling, a solution like {tailwind-css} also comes in the same direction, providing more simplicity and build an ecosystem around a simple concept.

It will be interesting to see what become the React Server components in 2021.

Thank you for your interest, and see you next year!
