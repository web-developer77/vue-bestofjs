It was another great year in the JavaScript landscape with several new leaders in the different categories tracked by _Best of JS_.

Backend developers can have fun with {deno} and start hacking with TypeScript right away without having to worry about dependencies.

Frontend developers now have faster and simpler build tools with solutions such as {esbuild}, {snowpack} and {vite}.

Speaking of tooling, the [version 7](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/631877012766785536/release-v700) of NPM provides [workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces) to handle several packages in a single repository, it was one of the big benefits provided by its rival [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

For styling, a solution like {tailwind-css} also comes from the same direction, providing more simplicity and it's building an ecosystem around a simple concept.

What to expect for 2021?

It will be interesting to see what comes of the React Server Components.

I'm curious how far {rome} project will go, in its attempt to unify the JavaScript tooling: could it be the single dependency to handle compiling, testing, linting... everything?

I'd keep an eye on the fullstack framework {redwood} project too, that plays well with GraphQL and has a unique way to handle data fetching using what they call "cells".

Thank you for your interest, and see you next year!
